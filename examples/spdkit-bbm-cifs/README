A workflow to submit cif files (jobs) in parallel using a single VASP
BBM template (vasp-opt-bbm)

# step 1: prepare inputs
- put cif files into jobs directory
- change VASP parameters in vasp-opt-bbm by replacing INCAR, KPOINTS, POTCAR files
- POTCAR can also be created automatically from POSCAR (see vasp-opt-bbm/submit.sh). Required steps:
  - make a symbol link to target potential for each element in vasp-opt-bbm/pot directory
  - generate POTCAR by call generate-potcar-from-poscar.py script

# step 2: submit main job to queue:
bsub < ./run.chess

# step 3: add a new worker for main job using bsub
bsub < ./add-new-worker.chess

# step 4: check outputs in jobs directory
- for example: 201.cif => 201/{vasp.log, CONTCAR, OUTCAR, OSZICAR}

# step 5: when main job (scheduler) done, do not forget to kill worker job
